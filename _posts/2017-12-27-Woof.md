Lately i've been working on a little project in my free time. The idea was born from my frustration regarding the basic features of cell phones. I'm not talking about smart phones per-say but i'm talking about the basics. We get a phone number, and this number is an open address that anyone or anything can reach you at. Perhaps this made sense when we had one or two ways to get in contact with someone who wasn't located at home. Now we have a million ways. The amount of notifications in our lives is crazy. As advertisers get more aggressive and technology allows us to place calls from a myriad of devices, the end consumer gets the short end of this stick. So in an effort to balance the power I wanted to give users the ability do things like whitelist incoming calls. IMHO the only people who should be able to make the thing I carry in my pocket vibrate are people that I know and who I approve to contact me.
